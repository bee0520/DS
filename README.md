## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3.*.

## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from 2016-01 to 2017-01 to better understand:

1. When should I visit Seattle? Based on the availability of the month and the average price of the month. 
2. Does the number of reviews lead us to a cheaper price? 
3. What are the other factors affect the price? 
4. Using the factors to predicte the listing price. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).
