## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Python 3.*.

## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from 2016-01 to 2017-01 to better understand:

1. When should I visit Seattle? Based on the availability of the month and the average price of the month. 
2. Does the number of reviews lead us to a cheaper price? 
3. What are the other factors affect the price? 
4. Using the factors to predicte the listing price. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 

- Ratio for each Month
- the Factors that Affect Price
- Price_Prediction

Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@wizchu/tips-for-booking-cheap-seattles-airbnb-81d4d772a5c6).
